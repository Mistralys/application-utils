# Application Utilities

Drop-in static PHP utility classes for common tasks, from file system related
operations and variable conversions to image manipulation.

## Requirements

- PHP v7.3+
- Extensions: MBString, CURL, Json

## Installation

Simply require the package with Composer:

```
composer require mistralys/application-utils
```

Also see the [Packagist][] page.

### Translation support

To enable localization of any translatable strings in the package, 
require the [Application Localization][] package as well. German and 
French translations are included, and the integrated interface 
allows adding additional translations.

Other translation solutions are not supported.

```
composer require mistralys/application-localization
```

> Note: The `StringBuilder` helper's translation methods depend
> on the package being installed.

## Quickstart

The package is meant to simplify day to day development tasks, from
common file system related access to converting data types. It uses
exception-based error handling, so there is no need for checking 
PHP function return values for `false`.

There is no central factory for accessing the helpers. Instead, each
static helper class has its own factory methods and acts as hub for 
all related tasks.

For example, all file related tasks live in the `FileHelper` class.

```php
use AppUtils\FileHelper;

// Replacement for file_get_contents
$content = FileHelper::readContents('path/to/file');
```

Likewise, conversion methods live in the `ConvertHelper` class.

```php
use AppUtils\ConvertHelper;

$bool = ConvertHelper::string2bool('yes');
```

The helpers overview below can give you an idea of what is available.

## Documentation

Documentation for the helper classes is ongoing in the [Application Utils Wiki][].

## Origin

These classes are still in use in a number of legacy applications. They were originally 
scattered over all of these applications, with their code diverging over time. This 
repository aims to consolidate them all into a single package to make it easier to maintain 
them.

As the legacy applications are still being maintained, this package is actively maintained
and being modernized.
